# K_means

We begin our clustering unit, and the first method we learn is the K-means method.  The slides are available in KMEANS.pdf.

* In python_kmeans.py, I provide a skeleton of the code I used to produce the results in class.  You are expected to fill in the blanks based on the class discussion, the slides, and the in-code comments.  **Please** do not use these skeleton notes until after you've thought about the problem and have unsuccessfully implemented your own code.  You will cheat yourself otherwise.

* In iris.csv, you have direct access to a dataset.  In python_kmeans.py, you learn ONE way of reading this dataset in to the Python workspace.
